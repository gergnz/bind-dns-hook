This is a hook designed to work with [https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated]

It is sadly not python3 compatible at this time.

```
virtualenv -p python2.7 venv
```

## Install
It uses a forked version of blockstack-zones [https://github.com/blockstack/dns-zone-file-py]
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
